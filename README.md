# SMART Soccer Coaching Servcies

This is a website built for educational purposes, where the context presented is to promote my (Gustaf Ljungwaldh's) coaching services, based in Stockholm, Sweden. 
My coaching services would aim towards players, parents and soccer teams, as well as provide content that can help aspiring players/coaches. 
I am currently a coach at one of Stockholm's elite clubs Djurgårdens IF, and wish I wish to also offer my expertise on a consultant/personal trainer basis.

The website will help to inform customers about:
* Myself (Gustaf Ljungwaldh) and my coaching profile
* My philsophy towards coaching and player development
* Services I provide
* A blog where I share free content
* How they can request for my services

The services available will range from coaching individuals, groups, and soccer teams. The service will be hourly rates for individuals and groups, aiming to run tailor-made training sessions. 
Coaching services for soccer teams will be custom-made offerings based on the needs of the team, where filling out the service request form will provide a starting point of discussing scope 
and pricing for the team's custom-made service.

Business goals of website include:
* Build awareness of my coaching services
* Drive my own business on the side of my current work with Djurgårdens IF
* Promote a positive brand of myself as a coach

Goals of customer for my website include:
* Find high quality content they can utilize immediately for becoming better football players/coaches
* Clear understanding of services available and pricing model
* Convenient way of requesting my coaching services

## UX

### Ideal customer
#### The customers visiting my website would be:
* English speaking
* Living in Stockholm, Sweden
* Have disposbale income
* A parent of a player, a player in a team, or a coach of a team

#### Visitors of my wbesite are looking for:
* Inspiration for improving themselves as players and/or coaches that can be used right away
* Professional support for a player's/group's/team's development

#### This project and website can provide a great solution for them for the following reasons:
* Sparse amount of soccer coaches offering this kind of service in the Stockholm area
* No coaches in the Stockholm area providing information and language of service in English, therefore making it difficult for the international community
* Websites with similar services offered in the Stockholm area are either poorly designed or provide too much information, therefore not providing a great user experience
* My website will emphasize great user design and experience, aiming for simplicity so more focus can be placed on action/taking the next step for customers. The website will be easy to navigate, provide clear and concise information, and all this will lead customers towards the service request form easily.

#### User Stories

# Features

### Consistent Features

Ever-present features within the website include a **fixed navigation bar**, allowing easy access to other parts of the website without having to scoll to
the top of the page. The navigation bar contains a **logo** on the left-hand side and the **menu items** on the right-hand side. In mobile view,
the menu items compress under a **burger icon button**, which when clicked on produces a **dropdown list** with the menu items listed. The menu items
redirect users to the respective pages of 'Home', 'Training', 'Blog', and 'Contact'. Clicking on the logo in the navigation bar will also redirect users to the 'Home'
page.

The **monochrome background image** is ever-present throughout the website, setting the tone for the colour scheme throughout the website, alongside the navigation bar and the footer.

The **footer**, like the navigation bar, appears on every page, containing the **logo and short text about the creator of the website**, while the **social media icon links** appear
on the right side of the footer. This can help guiode the user to more content related to the website on other social media platforms. 

A design principle that consistent throughout the website (except for the blog pages with a blog post inside) is that **information is presented in groups of three**, each taking
a third of the width of the page. These sections in thirds are also presented with a level of opacity - this giving exposure to the main background image while still
allowing the user to read the content presented. The design is aimed to give a positive user experience, where the subtle presence of the background image at all times
gives the sense of power towards training.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* Inclusion of a logo in the navigation bar (in the top left), chose to include this to give the website and brand more identity and exposure
* Content of Footer including a logo and short information about the creator of the website on the left, and social media icons with links on the right-hand side. Originally planned to have name of website and contact details here, but chose this approach since I wanted users to contact me via the contact form instead of through my own contact details

### Home

Users land on the home page, first seeing the **hero header and slogan**. This page takes a predominatly monochrome theme towards black and white, this colour scheme continuing
on to the About Me, SMART Philosophy, and How I can Help You sections. These three pieces of information cover the introduction of the website and overview of what's on offer.
This helps users to identify quickly what to expect from the website - that Gustaf Ljungwaldh provides soccer coaching services. Each section of the introduction also 
includes **black and white photos** to give further context to the section header and text. On smaller, mobile devices, these introduction sections stack on top of each
other vertically as apposed to aligning horizontally in larger screens.

Below the initial introduction section features a **carousel** for the testimonial section. The section has a clear heading, and presents three testimonials at a time (with 6
in total). To give the page some colour and contrast, the testimonial cards are given a dark blue bnackground colour as well as **full colour photos** to give visual profile
of the testimonials. On smaller, mobile devices, the carousel changes to presenting one testimonial is presented at a time instead of three. This is to ensure that users don't
become overwhelmed by three carousel items scrolling across when stacked vertically on top of each other. The carousel scrolls automatically, however, users can click on
the left and the right of the carousel to move to the previous/next carousel item/set. Users can also navigate on the carousel by clcicking on one of the bars Below
the carousel row.

The sections of the introduction and the cards in the carousel all have **hover stylings applied**, giving users subtle feedback on which piece of content they are hovering
over and focusing on. This is done by the images enlarging themselves slightly when the section/card is hovered over.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* None, the home page followed same idea as the wireframe, a layout I was confident of in giving a good user experience

### Training

Following the same format as the home page, with a main page heading, followed by content presented in three columns aligned horizontally across the whole width of the page.
The colour scheme is instead a dark green tone to give a nice contrast to the black and white theme. Below the main Training page header lies a **promotion button**.
When hovering over the promotion button, the background colour transitions into a darker shade of green, and when clicked, it will redirect the user to the contact page,
where they can send a booking request. The three-part information section describes the different training offers available, pricing and conditions. These sections
give subtle user feedback, much like the home page, when hovering over each respective column. Content is arranged in a similar way to the home page on smaller and mobile devices,
where the columns are stacked on top of each other vertically. **Full colour photos** are attached with text content to support context of the information.

Below the information content is an **embedded Google Map location** with a clear heading to indicate where trainings take place. Lastly, the feature below the 
Training Location is a **button for Training Times**. Clicking on this button will produce a modal presenting training time availability, to help users get a better
idea of between what times trainings will take place. The modal provides **buttons to close the modal and also to 'Book Training'**, which redirects users to the
contact page where they can submit a service request.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* Opted for one colour across this page as opposed to a different colour for each third of the training offers information section. This was to ensure a congruent design with the other pages, where they too would have one colour each
* Included embedded Google Map for the training location. This was to give extra information to users in case this kind of question would arise from contactees, helping to give a more indepemndent user experience
* Added button and modal for presenting training time availability, with the option to redirect users to the Contact page. This is for the same reasons as the Google Map location addition, while also adding another customer journey towards making a service request at another decision point of the website.

### Blog Page - Start

A set of three cards are presented horzontally across the page's width, each one describing a blog category. A main page heading precedes the blog
categories with consistent placement  The same responsiveness rules apply to these cards for hovering and for smaller/mobile devices as the home page. 
**Each card is hyperlinked to their respective blog cateogry pages**, where users can then read blog content, these categories being 'For Players', 'For Coaches', and
'Inspiration from Others'.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* Previewing only the blog categories as opposed to the blog category with one or two blog post previews. This is ultimately due to time constraints, where making more html pages for more blog posts was not realistic in respect to the time frame of the project

### Blog Page - For Players

The blog category page for Players, much like the other blog pages, differs in layout compared to other pages on the website. The layout instead present **blog post content**
for two thirds of the width of the page, while the third on the right of the page includes a See Also section with **cards that redirect users to their respective blog category pages**. 
Blog post content consists of a heading, sub-heading with date, blog post image, blog text, and interactive content lowest down. This blog post stucture is consistently
applied to the other two blog category pages as well. For this blog category page, the blog post features an **embedded Youtube video** related to the blog post content. On mobile/smaller
devices, the content is instead orgnaized with the blog post just below the main page heading, followed by the blog category cards. The hover effect used on other pages
is applied to the category cards too.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* Blog post takes up two thirds of the width of the page as opposed to the wghole width, allowing for 'See Also' content to take up the final third of the width of the page. This felt like a better design, espeically if mopre blog posts are posted with time, this would only push the category cards further down the page and be harder to find for users
* Blog post including interactive content, in this case a Youtube video. This was added to make the content more dynamic, appealing to more senses to the users can more easily digest the blog post depending on the media consumption preferences.

### Blog Page - For Coaches

This blog category page, in terms of design and responsiveness, follows the same principles as the other two blog category pages. The blog post content, like the one
for Players, includes the interactive content of an **embedded Youtube video** related to the blog post text content.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* Blog post takes up two thirds of the width of the page as opposed to the wghole width, allowing for 'See Also' content to take up the final third of the width of the page. This felt like a better design, espeically if mopre blog posts are posted with time, this would only push the category cards further down the page and be harder to find for users
* Blog post including interactive content, in this case a Youtube video. This was added to make the content more dynamic, appealing to more senses to the users can more easily digest the blog post depending on the media consumption preferences.

### Blog Page - Inspiration from Others

This blog category page, in terms of design and responsiveness, follows the same principles as the other two blog category pages. The blog post content includes **two images as interactive content which are hyperlinked**. 
Clicking on an image will redirect users to a page where they can buy the book that is advertised, with the imagesbeing the front covers of the books.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* Blog post takes up two thirds of the width of the page as opposed to the wghole width, allowing for 'See Also' content to take up the final third of the width of the page. This felt like a better design, espeically if mopre blog posts are posted with time, this would only push the category cards further down the page and be harder to find for users
* Blog post including interactive content, and in this case, responsive images that redirect users to a website where they can buy the books recommended. This is to ensure convenience in the user expereince for those who are curious to purchase literature relevant for soccer coaching

### Contact

The contact page follows the same design and responsiveness principles as the Training and Home pages. In this page the user can find a form with a range of input types.
These input types include **radio buttons** to select the category of their inquiry, a **dropdwon menu** to select training type interest, **text inputs** for contact details and 
additonal information, as well as a **submit button**. If the user tries to click on the submit button without selecting a radio buttomn, entering text input for 'Full Name' and/or an valid 'Email' input,
the inputs will have pop up messages prompting the user to provide these required details correctly. If all required information is given and the user clicks the Submit
button the information will be submitted and the Contact page will be reloaded.

#### Deviations from Wireframe

* Did not include the information columns section and instead only included the contact form in the Contact page. This was a decision to simplify the page, reduce information overload, and allow users to quickly find and fill in the form.
* Replaced the checkboxes with dropdwon selection list for the training type interest - this was done since it felt that, considering user stories and profiles, it would be more logical that they would be decided on one type of training for sending one service request
* Included radio buttons to select inquiry type. This was included as an alternative to the information section that would've been above the contact form, therefore being part of the simplification process of the contact page - aiming to give a simpler and better user experience

This is all to ensure that users feel they can give all the relelvant information they can depeding on if they have question, want more information, or want to book training

## Features Left to Implement and Ideas for Future Development

* Video background - this could give a more modern and dynmaic look to the website as a whole, be it just included on the home page, in some pages, or in all pages - find suitable video brackground to replace background image
* Have more blog posts - this would contribute further to users seeking credibility of the coach and the coaching services being offered - requires more HTML pages
* Transition from a blog to a vlog (video blog) and/or audio blog - more video/audio content can contribute to greater userr experience for mobile user contexts (where it would be easer to listen than to read eg. while driving) - would require further embedding of video/audio content, and possibly production of own video/audio content
* With more blog content it would require the building of an archive, where blog posts have tags and placed in blog category directories - requires significant HTML input
* Modal to appear after submitting a form so that users can get feedback on a successfully completed form - requires Javascript, which is out of scope for this project
* Hover effects on content that are even more subtle than the currently implemented pseudo-class styling in order to give an even smoother user experience and reduce risk of negative distraction - requires further pseudo-class selector styling in CSS
* Option to switch language of website to Swedish so that potential customers I can serve, who will be based in Stockholm, Sweden, have an easier time understanding my content and my offerings - would require a significant amount of time to duplicate HTML files and translate all of the content to Swedish, which isn't feasible in the time frame of this project
* Include link/button to download my soccer CV so users can have a PDF format of my credentials should they desire it - In the timeframe of the project, it wasn't feasible to create a soccer CV for myself from scratch
* Prefilled contact form, where buttons on the Training page redirecting to the Contact page pre-select the radio button 'I want to Book Training' - this would require Javascript, which is out of scope for this project
* Button on the home page to redirect users to the Training page - this would help guide users to make a natural next step to finding out more about training offers, enabling a smoother customer journey - would require more time to code further HTML and CSS input
* 'Book Training' button being also present on the home page, allowing users that already know what they want and/or returning customers can navigate intuitively and efficiently to the contact form to request coaching services - would require more time to code further HTML and CSS input

# Technologies Used

* BoostrapCDN with Bootstrap 4 is utilized in order to give responsive structure for the website
* jQuery and Popper.js, to enable componenets within Bootstrap, especialy in terms of enabling a responsive navigatiomn bar
* Google Fonts - used to obtain the font families used throughout project of Oswald (for headers) and Roboto (for normal text)
* Font Awesome - icons that are enabled by Bootstrap 4, these icons providing basis on social media link icons and the website brand logo
* JavascriptCDN in order to enable hover selectors
* Pexels.com was one of my sources to find license-free photos, but this webnsite also provided great technology in giving different options for resolution download as well as the option for custom resolution size specification

# Testing

## Code Validation

To initially test the website I used the following validators:

- W3C Markup Validation Service for HTML, inserting code via direct input
    - index.html - found only two warnings regarding number of hyphens used in two comment lines (code lines 103 and 224), these hyphens being removed subsequently
    - training.html - Encountered errors such as:
        - Having buttons elements as descendents of anchor elements - resolved by removing the anchor elements on buttons and reformatting the buttons in HTML and CSS
        - Leaving unordored list elements without a closing tag, causing snowball effect on div's indicating unorderded list were still open
        - Having h5 elements within buttons - resolved this by removing h5 elements within buttons and reformatting the CSS to give the same presentation as before the validator check
        - Running code again through the validator came out with a positive result, with no errors/warnings
    - contact.html - single syntax error on code line 92 where select ID didn't match the syntax of the label for attribute in code line 91, checked code again subsequently with no errors/warnings
    - blog-start.html - No errors/warnings found
    - blog-players.html - No errors/warnings found
    - blog-coaches.html - No errors/warnings found
    - blog-inspiration - No errors/warnings found

- W3C CSS Validation Service 
    - No errors were found on my first check of the code via direct input of my CSS code
    - Second check conducted after editing HTML and CSS code to rectify previous errors encountered on HTML validator, again no errors/warnings found

## User Stories

Depending on the scope of information users from to cover for the purpoe of assessing the coach's credibility and the services provided, the path can be as short as
Home > Contact to the most elaborate user path of:
Home > Training > Blog > For Player/For Coaches/Inspiration from Others > Contact 
This will all depend on the user's previous knowledge of the website, their willingness to spend and how clear their needs are in terms of coaching services. 

Some users could go through the path of Home > Training > Contact since the training page contains two calls to action to redirect users to the contact page, these being the
promotion button, and the 'Book Training' button in the modal for Training Times. This path contains a sufficient amount of information to give good credibility of the coach
from the home page, the information of training types, and then the special offer to conveniently direct users to booking training. The Blog pages can support the credibility
building process for users should it be needed.

## Further Testing

1. Asked my classmates at Code Institute to review my website. Only comment was that the website did not appear clean on the Internet Explorer browser. One of our tutors at
Code Institute ensured us that this isn't an issue to be concerned about in regards to how our websites look in this particular browser.
2. Tested on a number of browsers, including Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari, where no deviations were found from one another.


# Deployment

I developed this project in GitPod, where I would commit to Git, and then push to GitHub via using the terminal in GitPod. I deployed this Github repository to GitHub pages via the following process:
* Logged into GitHub
* Under the tab 'Respositories', I selected First-Milestone-Project
* Subsequently I selected 'Settings' from the menu at the top of the page
* I scrolled down the page top the GitHub Pages section
* On the dropdown bar under 'Source', I selected 'master branch'
* Once I selected 'master branch' the page reloaded, and the website was deployed
* I scrolled down the page again to find the link to the deployed website witihn a green highlighted area of the GitHub pages section, where this section also notified me that my website is deployed

The master branch was the only branch used for this website.
